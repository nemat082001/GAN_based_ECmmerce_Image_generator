### **README: GAN-Based AI System for E-Commerce Product Image Generation**

---

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating photorealistic e-commerce product images. The system automates the process of creating high-quality product visuals, reducing the reliance on manual photography while maintaining brand consistency. The solution includes a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) for enhancing image detail and quality.

---

## **Features**
- **GAN-Based Image Generation**: Produces diverse and realistic product images with 88% accuracy on a 25,000-image training dataset.
- **Super-Resolution Enhancement**: Ensures 95% consistency with premium-quality imagery using SRGAN.
- **Scalable Solution**: Generates high-resolution product images for various e-commerce needs.
- **Automated Workflow**: Reduces manual effort and accelerates content production.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow/PyTorch (choose based on your implementation).
- **GAN Architecture**: Custom-designed Generative Adversarial Network for image generation.
- **SRGAN**: Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network for enhancing image quality.
- **Dataset**: 25,000 high-resolution product images for training and evaluation.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Prepare the dataset and place it in the designated directory (`/data`).

---

## **Usage**
1. Train the GAN:
   ```bash
   python train_gan.py
   ```
2. Train the SRGAN:
   ```bash
   python train_srgan.py
   ```
3. Generate Images:
   ```bash
   python generate_images.py --num_images <number>
   ```

---

## **Results**
- **Accuracy**: 88% on the training dataset.
- **Image Quality**: Enhanced with SRGAN, achieving 95% consistency with premium-quality standards.
